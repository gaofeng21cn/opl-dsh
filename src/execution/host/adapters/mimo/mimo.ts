/**
 * Official MiMo Code CLI (`mimo`) adapter for the Our Free Model source.
 *
 * The CLI runs its own agent loop over ACP; this adapter contributes only protocol,
 * permission, and pinning rules, exactly as the other external harnesses do. It never
 * implements a loop of its own and never guesses work the public interface already owns.
 *
 * Authentication is not the official MiMo account: the model belongs to a registered
 * model source, so the credential is read by that plugin and reaches this adapter only
 * as a resolved route. Nothing here reads, copies, or logs the key, and the key is
 * never written to a file, a profile, or a repository path.
 *
 * What the official CLI genuinely offers, as of the pinned source:
 *
 *  - `initialize` advertises protocol v1 with `loadSession`, so new and restored
 *    sessions are both real; `session/cancel` aborts a run.
 *  - `session/new` and `session/load` return `configOptions` holding exactly two
 *    selects: `model` and `mode`. There is no reasoning/effort option, so no effort is
 *    ever sent, and a caller that asked for one is refused instead of ignored.
 *  - `session/set_config_option` writes the model and returns the refreshed
 *    advertisement, which is what makes a read-back check possible.
 *  - Permission decisions are forwarded to the client as a real request; nothing about
 *    that exchange restricts the agent to a working directory, so restricted sandboxes
 *    are refused rather than approximated.
 *  - `session/prompt` does not report a model-side failure: it returns `end_turn` with
 *    no body and no tool for a request the model never answered, so a turn is only
 *    reported complete when it produced body text or a completed tool.

 * Refuse the empty `end_turn` that official MiMo Code reports for a request the

 *
 * MiMo Code 0.1.15 builds its ACP prompt result from the SDK reply without
 * inspecting the assistant message's error, so a controlled HTTP 400 and a
 * controlled HTTP 429 both come back as `stopReason: end_turn` with zero usage,
 * no body and no tool. This suite rejects that shape instead of publishing a
 * completed turn, because a completed turn is what the queue, the notification
 * and the user all read as real finished work.
 *
 * Accepted outcomes, both of which are work the user actually asked for:
 *
 *  - body text on its own — the answer is the deliverable, tool calls or not;
 *  - at least one tool that actually completed — a silent run that really did the
 *    work is still work, and requiring prose to certify it would reject it.
 *
 * Reasoning never counts as body, so a turn that only thought is empty. A tool
 * that failed, was still pending, or never reported a status is not a completed
 * tool either: on its own it leaves nothing to show, and it must not be dressed
 * up as success. Body text still wins when both are present, because the model
 * then told the user about the failure in its own words.
 *
 * The transport carries no original HTTP status and no upstream error text, so
 * none is reconstructed or guessed here. The refusal states only what was
 * observed, and the request is never replayed against another model or channel.
