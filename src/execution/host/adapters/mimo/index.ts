/**
 * Public entry for the official MiMo Code (`mimo`) adaptation.
 *
 * The suite's shared adapter index is owned elsewhere; this module exports the adapter
 * and a small factory so wiring it in is a single, reviewable change that does not fork
 * any shared registry, catalog, or settings surface. Credentials stay with the model
 * source, the program stays with the execution engine, and the binding stays with the
 * execution combination — no new provider page, navigation entry, or duplicate config
 * is introduced here.
