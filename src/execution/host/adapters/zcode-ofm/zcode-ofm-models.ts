 * reused from `../zcode-protocol.ts`; this module only adds what the Our Free Model
 * route needs and cannot borrow from the Huawei MaaS route:
 *
 * - the exact model set this run adapts (`z-ai/glm-5.3`, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`);
 * - the reasoning levels the official shipped provider config declares for the GLM-5
 *   family, and nothing else;
 * - a provider config whose wire identity is the owner's catalog id, so the request
 *   that leaves the official CLI carries the exact model Our Free Model serves.
 *
 * The Huawei MaaS route stays exactly as it is. Nothing here reads, imports or
 * delegates to the Huawei credential reference, and the placeholder key below is a
 * different non-secret literal so the two relays cannot be confused for one another.
