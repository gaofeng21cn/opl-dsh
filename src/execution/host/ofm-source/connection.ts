/**
 * Connection facts for external Harnesses, read from the plugin's own public
 * Host API through an admitted caller.
 *
 * The plugin publishes a connection recipe at `GET /api/our-free-model/clients`
 * carrying the running forward endpoint, the issued key and the model ids that
 * lane currently serves. That response is the origin of a legitimate `baseURL`
 * and `apiKey`; reading it is ordinary authenticated use of the plugin's public
 * surface, not a read of its config files and not a guess at a port.
 *
 * Admission is not bypassed here. This module issues no request of its own — it
 * is handed a caller the Host's official wiring already authenticates — and a
 * refusal is treated as a refusal.
 *
 * The base URL is composed from the plugin's published origin and the requested
 * protocol, following the plugin's own recipes: the OpenAI-compatible surfaces
 * (`/v1/responses`, `/v1/chat/completions`) use `<origin>/v1`, while the
 * Anthropic surface (`/v1/messages`) uses `<origin>` and adds the versioned path
 * itself. Recipes are never parsed or executed — a snippet is documentation for a
 * human, and evaluating one would run whatever text the response carried.
 *
 * The issued key is execution data. It is returned to the Host for the launch and
 * never logged, catalogued, embedded in an error, or exposed to a model.
 *
