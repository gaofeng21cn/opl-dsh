/**
 * Keep the OPL model projection live.
 *
 * The official Host computes one durable `modelSelection` projection per
 * Session and pushes every finished value through the Session control stream.
 * That projection is exactly the "next request" intent: `next` is the selection
 * the following request uses, while `lastUsed` is what an already-recorded
 * request consumed. The OPL menu owns only the combination binding around that
 * official selection, so it must read the pushed projection instead of a
 * one-shot RPC — otherwise an external writer (an official CLI harness, the
 * Codex helper) changes the model while the composer keeps showing the value
 * it read when it mounted.
 *
 * The RPC stays as the fallback: it resolves the OPL combination bound to the
 * official selection, and it answers before the first projection frame reaches
 * a freshly opened Session.
