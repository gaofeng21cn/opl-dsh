/**
 * Task feedback: durable registration of dispatched work, a model-free watcher
 * over the bound Sessions, and an outbox that hands one bounded completion
 * notification to the Session that dispatched the task.
 *
 * What this service promises, and what it does not:
 *
 * - A successful transport handoff is sent once; only a refused handoff is
 *   retried. A delivery id is stable per task state, acknowledgments only move
 *   forward, and a repeated notification is a no-op for the receiver. No
 *   exactly-once delivery is claimed, because no transport can make that promise.
 * - A claim has an explicit owner, generation, and lease. `receive` answers
 *   `review` for the first claim, `resume` to the consumer that owns an
 *   unfinished claim, `busy` to a different consumer while the owner's lease is
 *   live, and `skip` after consumption; `consume` rejects a generation the owner
 *   no longer holds. An expired or crashed consumer's claim is reclaimed by a
 *   new generation, which is how an interrupted review is taken over without
 *   racing the consumer that is still working.
 * - A failure recorded as the exact reasoning_text protocol condition gets at
 *   most a configured number of bounded automatic resumes. `resumeFailed`
 *   claims the delivery, verifies the failed turn is still the target, and
 *   submits one persisted user instruction whose request id makes a duplicate
 *   notification or crash replay a no-op; the budget lives on the original
 *   task, so a restart or a retry under a new task id cannot reset it.
 * - A task's state comes from the Session's own durable events. A registered
 *   process exiting is not a completion, and an unreachable Session is
 *   `disconnected`: the task keeps its place and is neither cancelled nor
 *   re-dispatched here.
 * - The watcher never involves a model. It is an event subscription; a caller
 *   whose Host exposes no subscription can bound its own `session.wait`
 *   long-poll instead, which observes the same durable facts.
 * - Only metadata, one summary line, and local evidence references leave this
 *   process. Session output is quoted as untrusted result data, never as an
 *   instruction for the receiver.
 * - This service never answers an approval. A pause is reported and the
 *   Session keeps waiting for its human. The report is structured rather than a
 *   bare state: a needs-input notification carries the bounded questions and
 *   their options, or the approval and its tool, together with the Session the
 *   answer belongs to, so a dispatcher relays the question to its operator
 *   instead of guessing an answer or resuming the Session itself.
 *
